# Open Source Politics
The primary repository for LPoC.

###Introduction
Using established tools from the open-source software community can enhance the political process by offering greater transparency and accountability and by providing superior tools for effective collaboration and consensus decision making. The Libertarian Party of Canada embraces such technology as a medium for liberty and prosperity. Below is a brief on how to get involved.

####GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is the world's most popular open-source project hosting service. It essentially provides repositories for collaboratively edited files. It is similar to Google Docs, but more "task" oriented and with better channels for proposing and communicating about changes. Many of the world's most critical software projects are managed on github (eg. linux, most programming languages, openssl, etc.)

A project on github is a repository of files. Even the [White House](https://github.com/whitehouse) has several repositories. Public repositories are viewable by anyone while private ones have limited access. GitHub tracks alls proposed, accepted, and rejected changes made to a repository, and provides a friendly user-interface for reviewing and commenting on them. Recommendations and updates can be easily made, commented upon, debated, 'merged' into the main version, and referenced in future changes. 

To get started, follow a tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world 

Or simply create a Github account and request access to join this repository from an administrator. Note that you can create issues and propose changes *without* even being granted access! All you need is a Github account!

####Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a collaborative communication platform for teams of all sizes. It integrates all of your channels and does away with bulky e-mail or inneffective Facebook groups. For example, the [LPoC Slack channel](https://lpoc.slack.com/) currently has a handful of feeds. One displays all interactions and updates from the LPoC GitHub repo while another displays any interaction with the @LibertarianCDN twitter handle. 

If you are a candidate for the Libertarian Party of Canada, contact (someone@lpoc.ca). Invites will be sent out in the near future.
