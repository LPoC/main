# Open Source Politics
The primary repository for LPoC.

###Introduction
Using established tools from the open-source software community can enhance the political process. Long known for effective collaboration and consensus decision making, open-source is transparent and accountable by default. The Libertarian Party of Canada embraces technology as a medium for liberty and prosperity. Below is a brief on how to get involved.

####GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is the most popular open-source project hosting service. It is essentially a repository for files. You are currently in the main LPoC repository. Even the [White House](https://github.com/whitehouse) has several repositories. Public repositories are viewable by anyone while private ones have limited access. GitHub implements tracking of all changes to the contents of a repository. Recommendations and updates can easily be made, commented upon and debated, then 'merged' into the previous version.

To get started, create a GitHub account and request access from an administrator.

####Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a collaborative communication platform for teams of all sizes. It integrates all of your channels and does away with bulky e-mail or inneffective Facebook groups. For example, the [LPoC Slack channel](https://lpoc.slack.com/) currently has a handful of feeds. One displays all interactions and updates from the LPoC GitHub repo while another displays any interaction with the @LibertarianCDN twitter handle. 

If you are a candidate for the Libertarian Party of Canada, contact (someone@lpoc.ca). Invites will be sent out in the near future.
