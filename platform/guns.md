#Gun Ownership

The official position of the Libertarian Party of Canada is to remove the prohibitions and legislative obstacles for the ownership of guns by peaceful citizens for the purposes of recreation, self-defence and hunting.

If elected, the Libertarian Party of Canada would:

- Repeal section 91 and 92 of the Criminal Code to make responsible gun possession legal
- Revise the legal definition of weapon and firearm to reflect that guns are tools when in the hands of qualified civilians
- Eliminate the provincial and territorial Chief Firearms Offices as a cost saving mechanism and transfer responsible gun ownership to a certification based system
- Eliminate the unfair search and seizure provisions under the Firearms Act and reverse the onus provisions so that citizens are not labelled criminals before their day in court
