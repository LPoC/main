#Healthcare

The official position of the Libertarian Party of Canada is that the federal government should leave the entirety of health care decisions to provincial and territorial governments. The current system costs Canadians approximately $6,000 a year, per citizen. For the average family, their healthcare tax burden will be approximately $24,000 per year. Although Canadians spend a lot on the provision of healthcare, the system is painfully slow. The median wait time for an emergency room visit in Canada is 8.8 hours, which places Canada dead last among OECD countries for timeliness of care.

Not only do Canadians spend much of their time waiting for care, the system consistently underperforms. Canada is ranked in the bottom third of OECD countries for safe care, effective care, coordinated care and patient centered care.

To overcome these issues, the Libertarian Party of Canada would:

- Repeal the Canada Health Act
	1. To ensure that healthcare is a provincial responsibility
        2. To allow private alternatives for care and insurance, which will alleviate public wait times and the growing fiscal burden of healthcare. Provinces will be free to choose the system that best fits their needs
