#Environment

The Libertarian Party of Canada recognizes the importance of a clean and healthy environment to all Canadians. The property rights of all Canadians must be respected to ensure responsible and accountable use and preservation of our natural resources. As such, the Libertarian Party of Canada would:

- Enforce property rights so individuals have full ownership over their land and the natural resources above and below it
- Encourage a system whereby harm and property damage as a result of pollution can be dealt with through the judicial system
- Remove eminent domain legislation by repealing the Expropriation Act
