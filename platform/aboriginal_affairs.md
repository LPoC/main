#Aboriginal Affairs

The Libertarian Party of Canada recognizes the right of First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples to meaningful autonomy and jurisdiction over their territories. This jurisdiction includes natural resources, mining rights, local economic affairs and community membership.

The Libertarian Party would:

- Replace the Indian Act with a blanket guarantee of sovereignty for all indigenous groups.
- End all federal restrictions and obligations on indigenous territories
- Streamline the Land Claim process
- Find and eliminate systemic discrimination against indigenous peoples
