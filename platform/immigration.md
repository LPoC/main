#Immigration

Immigration is an essential aspect of a growing and prosperous country. As such, the Libertarian Party of Canada advocates for a welcoming immigration policy.

More specifically, the Libertarian Party of Canada would:

- Significantly decrease the bureaucratic burden for refugees and asylum seekers
- Eliminate the point system for immigration and replace it with a background check for violent or fraudulent criminal activity
- Eliminate the TFW program and replace it with a streamlined work visa program, and residency roll out. Granting foreign workers legal residency ensures that the Canadian economy continues to grow, without subjecting them to poor working conditions.
- Create sponsorship guidelines whereby organizations and individuals can sponsor immigrants if they are willing to financially support them.
