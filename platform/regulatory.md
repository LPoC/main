#Regulatory Agencies

The Libertarian Party of Canada realizes that government regulatory agencies often do far more harm than good. These regulatory agencies ultimately hurt consumers by increasing costs and curbing competition. As such, the Libertarian Party of Canada would:

- Repeal the powers of the CRTC over radio, television and communications
- Eliminate the unfair price manipulation and quota system of the Dairy Board.
- Reduce the CATSA and government fees for passengers coming from abroad to encourage more tourism and enterprise
