#Justice

The Libertarian Party of Canada opposes the criminalization of victimless crime. As such, the Libertarian Party would re-evaluate all victimless crimes in the federal criminal code. This will allow for law enforcement to spend its time and budget on targeting and punishing violent offenders.

	1. Sex work

The Libertarian Party of Canada would legalize sex work. Doing so respects the decisions of consenting adults, while making life safer for those who choose to engage in sex work. This policy also ensures that law enforcement can focus on human traffickers, and not its victims.

	2. The War on Drugs

The Libertarian Party of Canada would end the war on drugs by legalizing cannabis and immediately decriminalizing the consumption and possession of drugs. The war on drugs has cost Canadian tax payers billions of dollars in enforcement and incarceration of citizens who have harmed no one besides themselves. Drugs should be dealt with through harm reduction strategies, and as a matter of public health, not through the criminal justice system. The decriminalization of illicit substances ensures that organized criminals, both domestic and foreign, cannot profit from the drug trade.
