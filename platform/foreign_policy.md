#Foreign Policy

The Libertarian Party of Canada stands for a foreign policy of honest trade, peace, and diplomacy. As such, the Libertarian Party would:

- Immediately withdraw Canadian armed forces from international conflicts. The Libertarian party strongly opposes the foreign interventions of the past 13 years
- Reallocate military resources for the purpose of national defence, and Arctic sovereignty.
- Restructure the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development in the following way
 1.Eliminate all forms of government foreign aid
 2. Encourage remittances. Doing so means that aid is voluntarily given and done so without ending up in the hands of corrupt foreign governments.
 3. Unilaterally end all tariffs on foreign goods.
